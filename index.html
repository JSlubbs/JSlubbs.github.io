								<h3>The Opportunity</h3>
								<p>Thousands of brands and enterprise marketers use Conductor’s cloud-based SEO platform to manage their search visibility and the performance of their web content. When it comes to enterprise reporting, our users needed a quick and easy way to view reporting insights for multiple brands across different search engines, locations, and devices.</p>
								<h3>Goals</h3>
								<p style="margin-bottom: 0">Create a comparison reporting tool to help users in two ways: 
									<ol style="color: #666666">
										<li>1) Provide a bird’s-eye view of their website’s visibility in search results</li>
										<li>2) Surface relevant insights  to help marketers increase site traffic</li>

								<img src="images/tools/logo---zendesk-and-airtable.svg" class="zendesk-airtable-logo">
								<p><strong>Assessing pain points in the workflow.</strong> It starts with the user. Configuring and saving lots of similar reports is a very time-consuming and repetitive process. We started by conducting several user inquiries and scouring through product feedback. Our findings were that users had two major pain-points that we needed to address:</p>
								<ol style="color: #666666">
									<li>1) They wanted to see tracked keyword data across multiple domains, search engines, locations, and devices to understand the landscape of their website’s overall visibility.</li>
									<li>2) They wanted simple insights from this data that helped them to prioritize their website optimization efforts.</li>

								<h3>Design Process</h3>
								<p class="ux-tools">Tools used:</p>
								<img src="images/tools/logo---sketch-app.svg" class="sketch-logo">
								<p>Working with the product manager, I outlined a two-pronged approach to meet our users needs:<br><br>
									<strong>1)</strong> We could enhance the primary Keyword Performance feature to support multiple context reporting. This feature allows customers to deep dive into analysis on the visibility of individual keywords they're tracking for their website. By adding multiple context reporting, enterprise users would be able to aggregate and filter their visibility data across a range of dimensions.
									<img src="images/conductor/enterprise-reporting/keyword-performance-roll-up.gif" class="portfolio-image-asset" id="keyword-performance-roll-up"><br><br>
									<strong>2)</strong> We create a visibility comparisons feature, which would allow users to apply various contextual lenses on their keywords to surface summary level insights about which contexts to prioritize their efforts on.

								<h3>Conceptual design</h3>
								<p class="ux-tools">Tools used:</p>
								<img src="images/tools/logo---sketch-app.svg" class="sketch-logo">
								<p>After reviewing product feedback, we noted that our users vocalized a need to better understand their website visibility and optimization priorities based on location. Location is one of the most important reporting attributes for enterprise customers. Their websites receive millions of visitors from a variety of locations and they spend a great deal of effort optimizing their website content based on each one.<br><br>

								This spurred several rounds of design concepts and feedback sessions. I experimented with reporting on various metrics (monthly search volume, number of local results, top ranking results, count of volatile keywords, market share). I also tested different data visualizations to better understand how the user would effectively process and act on this information.<br><br>

									<li>2) The visibility comparison feature is slated to be deployed in early 2020. It will serve as the prototype for comparison reporting across locations along with a variety of additional dimensions, including domain, search engine, device type, and keyword category.<br><br>
										<strong>Have a clear direction.</strong> I designed this feature to deliver an executive level overview of location-based performance. Users will see immediate insights on optimization opportunities based on location, how performance changes over time, deep-dive into workflows, and combine various filter contexts to fine tune optimization efforts.</li>

								<h3>The Opportunity</h3>
								<p>Thousands of brands and enterprise marketers use Conductor’s platform to manage their search visibility in search results and the performance of their web content. However, as search engines like Google evolve from ten blue links to more dynamic content, our users needed deeper insights on how they were showing up in results. For example, when and where are <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cat+videos" target="_blank">videos</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=pizza+around+me" target="_blank">local results</a> appearing? As designer on this project, I set out to optimize our reporting capabilities to give marketers deeper insights around their performance.</p>

We conducted several user inquiries and reviewed product feedback. Our findings indicated that users had four pain-points that we needed to address:</p>

								<p>I started out by outlining what information would be most valuable to surface to users, and considered how best to build the right story.

								<img src="images/tools/logo---gong-io.svg" class="gong-io-logo">
								<p>After several rounds of testing, my participants left me with a clear direction on enhancing this feature. We needed to make it simple to understand all result types by providing the following functionality:</p>
								<ul class="bullet-dark-bg">
									<li>Summarize all result types, including appearance and ownership</li>
									<li>Support workflows to deep-dive on a result type</li>
									<li>Trend individual result types, comparing appearance and ownership</li>
									<li>Provide granular reporting on result type ownership at a keyword level</li>

								<h3>A new starting point</h3>
								<p class="ux-tools">Tools used:</p>
								<img src="images/tools/logo---axure.svg" class="axure-logo">
								<p>I added a summary widget to support information on all result types - gone were the days where users had limited summary information. This allowed the user to quickly glance across all result types, and immediately understand where they should prioritize their efforts. Additionally, users could now see their ownership for each result type, in a snapshot, and trended out over time. And lastly, users could now deep-dive into analysis workflows for each individual result type and link into additional reports to optimize their content and target result type opportunities.</p>

								<p>Understanding ownership trends informs users about the search landscape. For businesses interested in educating their customers - this report could now help them determine what kinds of content their known competitors were creating. In doing so, they could fine tune their marketing efforts to create better targeted educational content, increasing the likelihood of them appearing at the top of the search page. Incorporating a view to focus on individual result types to see how result type ownership changes was vital.</p>

								<h3>Key Learnings</h3>
								<p>Understanding the search landscape and the level of content visibility therein is a difficult process. Search is constantly evolving, new mechanisms are being implemented at incredible speeds, and the search results page is a dynamic, often difficult to define space. My goal was to ensure that our users could not only understand its layout, but get deeper insights into how they appear there. Search results essentially reflect what the best answer is to a posited question.
								
								<br><br>What I have learned is that by educating users in context, providing the right fidelity of information to support their research needs, and helping them execute on their optimization goals - they'll not only become more efficient, but will ultimately provide more value to their customers.
								
								<hr class="in-section-divider-dark-bg">

								<br>In the meantime, I'm working on a concept to support reporting on multiple contexts, while exploring a streamlined visual design.</p>

								<h3>The Opportunity</h3>
								<p>Crunched is a full-service accounting platform that helps small businesses manage their finances. As the lead Product Designer on the team, I was tasked with outlining the information architecture, building out the design library, and designing an intuitive interface that enabled customers to easily maintain and automate their bookkeeping activities.</p>

								<h3>Problem</h3>
								<p>As a business owner, how do you ensure all of your accounts are in good standing, and how do you track & communicate about your company's financial health?<br><br>
								Current accounting solutions are antiquated, bloated, and are often overpriced. Most small and medium sized businesses are looking for a simple solution - one that is intuitive, integrates with 3rd party services, and doesn't force the user to sign up for features they don't need.</p>

								<img src="images/tools/logo---google-docs.svg" class="google-docs-logo">
								<p><strong>Understanding accounting needs of businesses.</strong> Accurate accounting is always a major component of every business, but isn't often the main focus. Talking to the product owners and conducting lots of prospect interviews, we reviewed everything from double-entry bookkeeping to invoicing and tax law. Our findings led to several core activities that we needed to support:</p>
								<ol style="color: #666666">
									<li>1) Defining an organization</li>
									<li>2) Importing financial accounts, customers, vendors, sales items, and fixed assets</li>
									<li>3) Configuring for compliance standards</li>
									<li>4) Manual and automatic recording all income and expenses</li>
									<li>5) Analyzing and sharing financial data</li>

								<h3>Design Process</h3>
								<p class="ux-tools">Tools used:</p>
								<img src="images/tools/logo---balsamiq.svg" class="balsamiq-logo">
								<p>I initiated wireframing core features such as the ability to record transactions. The first iteration of the feature set had to enable customers to manually enter in transactions before we could elevate the platform to smartly integrate with additional platforms. Having the ability to record transactions was paramount to establishing a proof of concept.<br><br>In parallel, I began to map out the information architecture and regularly checked in with our product owners to ensure that design direction was aligned with their vision.</p>

							<p>Having a simple solution for users to input their transaction data, and doing so in a familiar manner was the first step in verifying that the concept was sound and usable, especially for an audience that had a history of using similar platforms.</p>

									<li>1) To quickly chart their journal entries</li>
									<li>2) Split each transaction against multiple defined accounts</li>
									<li>3) Review and manage their complete entry history, and</li>

								<h3>Results</h3>
								<p class="ux-tools">Tools used:</p>
								<img src="images/tools/logo---sketch-and-zeplin.svg" class="sketch-zeplin-logo">
								<p>Crunched launched in April 2017. With a complete set of initial features delivered, their userbase rapidly increased. Customers quickly imported their accounting datasets into the platform to get started within minutes, managing their transactions within hours, and reporting on their business performance within days. The product owners were delivered a product with full design specifications.<br><br>
								<strong>Understand the vision.</strong> I designed the first version of Crunched with very clear goals in mind. I wanted to ensure that users could quickly integrate their data while transitioning from other accounting platforms, have full transaction management capabilities, ensure that they could adhere to compliance standards, effectively administer user permissions, and understand the financial health of their businesses. I also outlined the following design and development phase plan to ensure that Crunched could grow with the needs of their growing customer base.

								<h3>Key Learnings</h3>
								<p><strong>Industry knowledge.</strong> Accounting is its own language, and those in charge must be able to communicate effectively. From internalizing industry terminology, to pouring over compliance standards, to understanding accounting workflows - I was able to learn a great deal about this industry and all its professionals’ necessities.<br><br>
									<strong>End to end design.</strong> This application was a greenfield project. Starting from the ground up, I capitalized on a great opportunity to collaborate with the product owners to deliver an application that could contend with market giants. Building up the information architecture and design library, conducting research, and designing each feature, I was able to contribute to this project from strategic and tactical perspectives.
